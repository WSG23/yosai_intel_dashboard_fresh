# Step 20: Test Suite Validation

## Test Configuration:
- pytest.ini configured with:
  - Test paths: tests/, tests/cli, services/analytics_microservice/tests
  - Coverage requirement: 90% minimum
  - Multiple test markers (unit, integration, slow, database, performance)
  - Using .env.test for test environment

## Test Structure:
- Main test directory: tests/ (281 test files!)
- Subdirectories for different components
- Test doubles in tests/doubles/
- Integration tests in tests/integration/
- Performance tests in tests/performance/

## Execution Strategy:
1. Start with minimal dependency tests (doubles, unit tests)
2. Test recently migrated components (callbacks, imports)
3. Run full test suite if possible
4. Document any import failures that need fixing

## Note:
Running without coverage (--no-cov) initially to focus on import issues
