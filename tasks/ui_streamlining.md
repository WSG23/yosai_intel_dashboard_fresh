# Unified UI Streamlining Task

- **Scope**: `components/ui`, `components/analytics`, `components/upload/ui`, `pages`, `assets/css/01-foundation/_variables.css`
- **Goal**: Replace scattered callback patterns and hardcoded styles with modular components using consolidated callbacks and CSS tokens.
- **Steps**:
  1. Analyze existing UI components and callbacks to identify consolidation opportunities.
  2. Implement `StreamlinedComponent` base class with Unicode-safe data handling.
  3. Register all component callbacks via `TrulyUnifiedCallbacks` using a `StreamlinedCallbackManager`.
  4. Replace inline callback definitions (e.g., in `pages/file_upload_simple.py`) with `register_callbacks` methods.
  5. Replace hardcoded CSS values with tokens from `assets/css/01-foundation/_variables.css`.
  6. Deduplicate common modal toggles and upload processing logic.
  7. Provide isolated tests for each component following `tests/` patterns.
  8. Validate callback conflicts and CSS token usage as part of CI.

**Outcome**: A modular, testable, Unicode-safe UI with consolidated callback registration and consistent styling.
