# Deployment Runbook

## Rollout Procedure
1. Build and push container images.
2. Trigger the `canary` stage in `deployment/pipeline.yaml` or run `deployment/scripts/traffic_shape.sh`.
   The script honours `TARGET_ENV` (default `staging`) and `TRAFFIC_PERCENT` to apply the manifests and
   control the initial canary traffic share within that namespace.
3. Verify metrics and logs for the canary pods. Readiness and liveness probes should remain green before continuing.
4. Start `scripts/rollback.sh` to watch unlock latency and error SLOs. The script queries
   Prometheus and will undo the rollout if P95 latency exceeds **100â€¯ms** for 5 minutes or
   errors exceed **1%**.
5. Confirm log entries appear in the staging ELK and Datadog dashboards and include correlation IDs from test requests.
6. Execute the `traffic_shift` stage to gradually raise `TRAFFIC_PERCENT` as confidence grows.
7. Execute the `blue_green` stage to shift traffic using `k8s/bluegreen` manifests.
8. Remove the old color once the new version is healthy.

## Rollback Procedure
1. Re-route traffic back to the previous color or disable the canary.
2. Run `scripts/rollback.sh <deployment> <namespace>` or `kubectl rollout undo` to revert to the last known good image when SLOs are violated.
3. Monitor until service health is restored.
