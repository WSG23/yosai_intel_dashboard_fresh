"""Simple retry helper used by pooled connections.

The :class:`RetryStrategy` encapsulates retry logic with exponential
backoff suitable for dealing with transient failures such as temporary
network issues or database lock timeouts.  The delay doubles after each
failed attempt which gives the remote service time to recover.  The
strategy is intentionally lightweight â€“ callers can override the
default number of ``attempts`` and initial ``backoff`` delay per call to
match the characteristics of the operation being performed.

Example
-------

>>> retry = RetryStrategy(attempts=5, backoff=0.2)
>>> retry.run(unreliable_operation)

The above will attempt ``unreliable_operation`` up to five times,
sleeping for ``0.2``, ``0.4``, ``0.8`` ... seconds between retries.
