# Security Architecture

This document describes the system components, trust boundaries, and data flows.

## Components
- **API Gateway**: entry point for external clients enforcing authentication and rate limiting.
- **Service Layer**: microservices handling business logic.
- **Data Stores**: relational and document databases storing application data.
- **Analytics Pipeline**: processes events and generates intelligence.

## Trust Boundaries
- Boundary between external clients and the API Gateway.
- Segmentation between internal services and data stores.
- Separate analytics environment for processing sensitive data.

## Data Flows
- Clients interact with the API Gateway over HTTPS.
- Services communicate via authenticated internal network channels.
- Data from service layers flows to data stores with encryption at rest and in transit.
- Analytics pipeline consumes sanitized data and outputs reports to authorized users.
