"""Risk propagation utilities.

This module models how risk can spread through a trust network.  Each user
starts with a ``base_risk`` score.  Risk is propagated to connected users
according to the trust value of the connection â€“ lower trust results in a
greater proportion of the risk being transferred.  A simple decay factor is
applied at each iteration to prevent unbounded growth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_risks:
        Mapping of user id to initial risk score.
    trust_links:
        Iterable of ``(source, target, trust)`` tuples where ``trust`` is a
        value between ``0`` and ``1``.  A trust value of ``1`` means no risk is
        transferred whereas ``0`` transfers the entire risk (before decay).
    iterations:
        Number of propagation steps to perform.  Additional iterations allow
        risk to travel further through the network.
    decay:
        Fraction of risk that remains after each hop.
