# Upload Results Endpoint

This document summarizes the new `/api/v1/results/upload` endpoint, associated schema, migration notes, and test commands.

## Endpoint Summary

`POST /api/v1/results/upload`

Accepts an array of result objects via the `results[]` field and returns a 202 response once the upload is queued for processing.

### Example `results[]` Payload

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "result_id": 1,
      "device_id": "door-123",
      "status": "processed",
      "timestamp": "2024-07-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

| Field       | Type    | Notes                            |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| result_id   | integer | Unique identifier for the result |
| device_id   | string  | Source device identifier         |
| status      | string  | Processing state                 |

## Migration Notes

1. A new `results` table stores uploaded result records.
