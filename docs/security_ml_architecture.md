# Security Monitoring ML Architecture

This document outlines a high-level architecture for a next-generation security monitoring system. The goal is to evolve from fixed-threshold anomaly detection to a predictive, adaptive platform capable of detecting complex threats.

## 1. Deep Learning Models

- **Transformer Architecture**
  - BERT-style model for sequential access pattern analysis
  - Multi-head attention for differentiating threat types
  - Positional encoding to learn temporal relationships
- **LSTM/GRU Networks**
  - Bidirectional LSTMs for long-term temporal patterns
  - Attention-enhanced LSTM layers for long sequences
  - Multi-scale models capturing minutes, hours, and days
- **Autoencoder Networks**
  - Variational autoencoders for anomaly detection
  - Adversarial autoencoders for robust feature learning
  - Denoising autoencoders for noisy sensor data
- **Graph Neural Networks**
  - GraphSAGE for modeling user and device behavior
  - Temporal graph networks for evolving relationships
  - Heterogeneous graphs to represent multi-entity interactions

## 2. Ensemble Methods

- Gradient boosted trees (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost)
- Neural network ensemble with stacking and meta-learning
- Temporal ensemble for different time horizons
- Online learning ensemble for adaptation to drift

## 3. Feature Engineering

- Behavioral embeddings (User2Vec, location embeddings, time2vec)
- Statistical features (FFT, wavelets, entropy, Markov chains)
- Domain features (badge velocity, dwell time, access graph topology)

## 4. Multi-Modal Learning

- Fuse log data with video, network traffic, incident reports, and sensor streams
- Late fusion and cross-modal attention for joint reasoning
- Multi-task learning across modalities

## 5. Continuous Learning Pipeline

- Online learning with incremental updates and adaptive thresholds
- Active learning with analyst feedback loops
- Transfer learning and few-shot adaptation for new threat types

## 6. Explainability

- SHAP/LIME for model transparency
- Attention visualizations and counterfactual examples
- Confidence calibration and uncertainty quantification

## 7. Threat-Specific Models

- Insider threat detection incorporating sentiment and behavioral profiles
- Coordinated attack detection via multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Zero-day pattern recognition with one-class SVMs and generative models

## 8. Deployment & Monitoring

- Model serving with TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe
- Real-time performance and drift monitoring
- Automated retraining, experiment tracking, and model registry

## Technical Targets

- 1M+ predictions per minute with <50ms p99 latency
- Precision ≥95% and recall ≥90%
- Support for 1000+ features and GPU-accelerated training

## Deliverables

1. Library of production-ready models
2. Feature engineering pipeline
3. Model training framework
4. Real-time inference service
5. Explainability dashboard
6. MLOps infrastructure
7. Performance benchmarks
8. Analyst feedback interface

This document serves as an initial blueprint. Implementation will require iterative development, rigorous testing, and continual feedback from security analysts.
