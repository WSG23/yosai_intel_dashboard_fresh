# Progressive Disclosure

Progressive disclosure exposes advanced information and controls over time so users are not overwhelmed at once. This approach supports clear workflows while keeping the interface approachable for newcomers.

## Patterns
- **Stepwise forms**: Break lengthy forms into smaller sections that reveal the next step after the current one is completed.
- **Contextual panels**: Offer details in side panels or modals only when users request more information.
- **Adaptive menus**: Start with the most common actions and expand to show advanced options on demand.

## Information Hierarchy
- Present primary tasks prominently and defer secondary actions.
- Use visual hierarchy—typography, spacing, and color—to signal importance.
- Provide summaries before drilling into granular data, letting users choose the depth they need.

## Cognitive Load Principles
- Limit choices at each step to reduce decision fatigue.
- Group related controls and information so users can process them efficiently.
- Provide clear navigation cues and feedback to help users maintain context as new layers appear.
