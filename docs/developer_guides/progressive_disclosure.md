# Progressive Disclosure Developer Guidelines

The dashboard uses progressive disclosure to keep workflows approachable while still supporting expert use. The following guidelines help developers implement features that reveal complexity gradually.

## State Hooks
- Use lightweight state hooks to track whether advanced details are visible.
- Initialize with the simplest state and reveal additional panels only when the user opts in.
- Reset hidden state when users navigate away to avoid stale views.

## Feature Flags
- Wrap new progressive disclosure flows in feature flags so they can be rolled out gradually.
- Default flags to off and enable per environment or user cohort.
- Remove unused flags and code paths once a feature is fully launched.

## Testing Expectations
- Include unit tests for state hooks to ensure content toggles correctly.
- Add integration tests that exercise both the basic and advanced flows.
- Verify that accessibility requirements are met when new layers of information appear.
