# Microservices Gateway and Mesh Plan

This document outlines a proposed architecture for integrating an API gateway and a service mesh.

## API Gateway

The gateway will sit at the edge of the deployment and expose a single entry point for all HTTP traffic. Each service boundary is mapped to a set of routes in the gateway configuration. Security policies such as authentication and rate limiting are applied globally, while observability hooks forward metrics and traces to the monitoring stack.

## Service Mesh

Internal communication between microservices occurs inside a lightweight service mesh. Service entries represent each deployable unit. Traffic policies define how requests flow between them, enabling retries and circuit breaking. Observability is built in through distributed tracing and metrics collection.

The planner in `services/api_gateway_planner.py` produces skeleton configurations that can be expanded as the platform evolves.
