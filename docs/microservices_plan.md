# Microservices Decomposition Plan

This document summarizes the initial planning work for splitting the monolithic
application into smaller services.

## Service Boundary Identification

The `MicroservicesArchitect` inspects existing modules and groups related
responsibilities into draft service boundaries. In this simplified placeholder
implementation each module maps directly to a boundary so that the
architecture can be visualised early.

## Decomposition Roadmap

After boundaries are identified the next phase is **decomposition**. This phase
iteratively extracts modules into standalone services and defines integration
points between them. The generated roadmap lists the planned phases and the
order in which services will be carved out.
