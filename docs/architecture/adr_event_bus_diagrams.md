# ADR: Event Bus and Repository Diagrams

*Status*: Accepted

To clarify how core components interact, PlantUML diagrams are maintained under `docs/architecture/`:

- [Class hierarchy](class_hierarchy.svg)
- [Event bus overview](event_bus.svg)
- [Repository interfaces](repositories.svg)
- [Event processing sequence](event_processing_sequence.svg)

These diagrams document current design decisions for the event bus and persistence layers and serve as a reference for future changes.
