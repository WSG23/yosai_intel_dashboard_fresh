# Component Styling Guidelines

This project follows the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) for consistent look and feel across the dashboard. Below are key points to keep in mind when creating UI components.

- **Clarity** – Each component should clearly communicate its purpose. Use straightforward labels and standard controls.
- **Deference** – UI chrome stays light and unobtrusive, letting user data take center stage. Avoid heavy borders or shadows.
- **Depth** – Use layering and subtle animation to convey hierarchy and transitions.
- **Consistency** – Layouts, fonts, and colors should remain consistent across pages. Reuse existing styles when possible.
- **Feedback** – Provide immediate feedback for user actions, such as highlighting selected items or showing progress indicators.

Refer to Apple's documentation for more details on color usage, typography, and controls.
