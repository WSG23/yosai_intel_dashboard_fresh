# UI Guidelines

## Progressive Reveal

Use the `ProgressiveSection` component to hide complex metrics or settings until users request them. This pattern keeps interfaces focused while maintaining accessibility. It should wrap drillâ€‘down metrics and advanced settings that are not necessary for an initial scan of the page.

```tsx
<ProgressiveSection title="Advanced Settings">
  {/* advanced controls here */}
</ProgressiveSection>
```

Content wrapped in `ProgressiveSection` is hidden from screen readers and keyboard navigation until expanded, reducing noise for assistive technology users. Toggle buttons manage `aria-expanded`, while the content container uses `aria-hidden` and the `hidden` attribute.

## Responsive Design and Dark Mode

- The dashboard uses Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach. Apply responsive utility classes such as `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` to ensure components scale from phones to desktops.
- The navigation bar collapses into a menu on small screens. Dark mode is controlled by the `useDarkMode` hook, which toggles a `dark` class on the root element. Use Tailwind's `dark:` variant to style components for both themes.

### Testing

Run `npm test` in the project root to execute responsive layout tests and verify dark mode behavior.
