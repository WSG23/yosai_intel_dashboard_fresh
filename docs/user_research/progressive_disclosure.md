# Progressive Disclosure User Research

User interviews and usability tests show that gradually revealing advanced controls keeps participants confident and focused. Insights from our research inform how we structure learning paths and in-app guidance.

## Findings
- Users prefer starting with a simple overview and exploring deeper metrics on demand.
- Too many simultaneous options cause hesitation and errors, especially for new users.
- Contextual tips and inline help increase task completion rates when advanced features appear.

## Learning Paths
- Begin onboarding with core tasks and introduce secondary features after mastery of basics.
- Offer quick tours or tooltips when hidden panels first become available.
- Provide links to extended documentation or tutorials for power users seeking more depth.
