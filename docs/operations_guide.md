# Operations Guide

This document outlines how to monitor the dashboard and configure alerts.

## Alert Configuration

Alerts are emitted when background tasks fail or exceed the configured
threshold. Set the notification email and severity level in your YAML
configuration:

```yaml
alerts:
  email: ops@example.com
  severity_threshold: warning
```

The application sends messages to this address using the SMTP settings defined in
`config`. You can override these values via environment variables in production.

## Performance Dashboards

Prometheus scrapes metrics from `/metrics` using the sample
`monitoring/prometheus.yml`. Import this data source into Grafana to build CPU,
memory and request charts. Logs can be forwarded to Elasticsearch through
`logging/logstash.conf` and visualized with Kibana.
