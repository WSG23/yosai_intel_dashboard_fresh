# ADR 0001: BaseComponent

## Context
We needed a consistent foundation for UI elements across dashboards to promote reuse and enforce shared behavior.

## Decision
Introduce a BaseComponent abstraction that encapsulates common rendering and lifecycle hooks. All higher-level UI pieces derive from this base to keep styling and state management uniform.

## Consequences
- Simplified creation of new components.
- Centralized maintenance of shared logic.
- Slight learning curve for contributors unfamiliar with the abstraction.
