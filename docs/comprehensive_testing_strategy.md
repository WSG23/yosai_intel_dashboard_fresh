# Comprehensive Testing Strategy (10/10)

This document outlines a reference implementation for achieving a full “10/10” testing score in the Yōsai Intel Dashboard project. The goal is to cover unit, integration, contract, performance and end‑to‑end scenarios with automated reporting.

## Testing Pyramid

```
         E2E Tests (5%)
       /            \
    Integration (20%) \
   /                   \
  Contract Tests (15%)  \
 /                       \
Unit Tests (60%)
```

## 1. Unit Testing

- **Go** – use `gomock` for mocks and `testify` for assertions.
- **Python** – rely on `pytest` and `unittest.mock`, including async fixtures.
- Aim for coverage >80% and include benchmark tests when possible.

## 2. Integration Testing

- Launch dependencies with **Testcontainers** for both Go and Python tests.
- Exercise real database, Redis and Kafka components.

## 3. Contract Testing

- Use **Pact** for consumer and provider verification.
- Publish pacts to a broker during CI.

## 4. Performance Testing

- Run **k6** and **Gatling** scripts under a dedicated CI job.
- Check latency, throughput and error‑rate thresholds.

## 5. End‑to‑End Testing

- Implement flows in **Cypress** and **Playwright**.
- Validate real‑time UI updates and behavior under load.

## 6. Security Testing

- Automated OWASP ZAP scans for common vulnerabilities.
- Container and dependency scans (e.g. Trivy).

## 7. Chaos Engineering

- Use **Litmus** experiments such as pod delete, network latency and CPU stress.

## 8. Mutation Testing

- Optional mutation tests with `go-mutesting` for critical packages.

## 9. Property‑Based Testing

- Validate invariants with tools like `gopter` (Go) and `hypothesis` (Python).

## 10. Continuous Automation

- GitHub Actions workflow executes all test stages.
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov and performance results saved as artifacts.

This approach provides a comprehensive safety net and ensures new code paths remain well tested as the project grows.
