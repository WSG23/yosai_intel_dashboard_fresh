# Post-Deployment Penetration Testing Guide

This guide outlines how to perform security testing against a deployed instance
of the Yosai Intel Dashboard.

## Configuration

Use the provided configuration overrides in
`deployment/pentest-config.yaml` to relax rate limits and enable verbose
logging. Apply the configuration during deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dashboard helm/chart -f deployment/pentest-config.yaml
```

## Recommended Tools

1. **OWASP ZAP** – Automated scanning for common vulnerabilities.
2. **Nmap** – Network mapping and service enumeration.
3. **SQLMap** – Detect SQL injection flaws.
4. **custom scripts** – Probe business logic and authorization paths.

## Running Tests

1. Ensure the environment is deployed with pentest configuration.
2. Execute OWASP ZAP against the public endpoint:

   ```bash
   zap-baseline.py -t https://<host>/ -a -r zap-report.html
   ```

3. Run `npm audit` and `safety` against running services for dependency
   issues.
4. Report findings in a security ticket and rotate any credentials used
   during the test.

## Cleanup

After testing, revert to the standard configuration to restore default
security posture.
