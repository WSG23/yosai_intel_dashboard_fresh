# Contributing to Y≈çsai Intel Dashboard

Thank you for considering a contribution! Follow these steps to get the development environment ready.

## Setup

Install the core and development dependencies along with the packages
required for running the tests:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
npm install
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The hook will automatically run each time you commit. To verify all files at
once execute:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

These additional packages provide linting, type checking, security scanning and testing tools used in our CI pipeline.

## Installing Test Dependencies

The unit test suite requires additional packages specified in
`requirements-test.txt`. Install them prior to running the tests:

```bash
./scripts/install_test_deps.sh
```

Alternatively you can run `pip install -r requirements-test.txt` directly.

## Running Tests

After installing the dependencies (including those from
`requirements-test.txt`) you can run the tests and code quality checks:

```bash
pytest
mypy --strict .
flake8 .
isort --check .
black --check .
bandit -r .
```

Run `isort .` to automatically sort imports before committing changes.

See [docs/test_architecture.md](docs/test_architecture.md) and
[docs/testing_with_protocols.md](docs/testing_with_protocols.md) for details on
the testing protocols, container builder and available test doubles.

Please ensure tests and linters pass before opening a pull request.
